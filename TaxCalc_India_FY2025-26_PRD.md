## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Every year, crores of salaried Indians have no idea which tax regime (Old vs New) saves them more money. Existing calculators are confusing, ask for CTC or gross salary (which most people don't know), and present results in dense financial jargon. Users need a simple, trustworthy tool that starts from what they actually know — their monthly take-home salary.

### 1.2 Solution
A step-by-step wizard that asks one question at a time in plain, non-finance language. A live preview panel updates tax estimates in real-time. The result page gives a clear, human-readable recommendation: "Pick this regime. You save ₹X." with side-by-side comparison, slab-by-slab breakdown, personalized education, and practical suggestions.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Salaried individuals in India (ages 21–60+)
- First-time job holders who don't understand tax jargon
- Anyone confused by Old vs New regime choice
- NOT for: business owners, freelancers, those with capital gains, or incomes above ₹50 lakh (surcharge territory)

### 1.4 Design Philosophy
- **Simplicity:** One question per screen
- **Trust:** Clean, modern, minimal design
- **Transparency:** Live preview, clear explanations
- **Privacy:** All calculations run in the browser — no data leaves the device

## 2. Tax Rules & Calculation Engine (FY 2025-26)

### 2.1 New Tax Regime (Section 115BAC) — FY 2025-26

**Tax Slabs (All Age Groups — Same Slabs):**

| Income Range (₹) | Tax Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 4,00,000 | Nil |
| 4,00,001 – 8,00,000 | 5% |
| 8,00,001 – 12,00,000 | 10% |
| 12,00,001 – 16,00,000 | 15% |
| 16,00,001 – 20,00,000 | 20% |
| 20,00,001 – 24,00,000 | 25% |
| Above 24,00,000 | 30% |

**Key Features:**
- **Default regime** for all taxpayers
- **Standard Deduction:** ₹75,000 for salaried employees
- **Section 87A Rebate:** Up to ₹60,000 if taxable income ≤ ₹12,00,000 (making income up to ₹12 lakh tax-free; up to ₹12.75 lakh for salaried with standard deduction)

**Tax Calculation Formula (New Regime):**
```
1. Gross Salary = Monthly Take-Home × 12 + Other Income (if any)
2. Taxable Income = Gross Salary - Standard Deduction (₹75,000)
3. Tax = Apply slab rates on Taxable Income
4. If Taxable Income ≤ ₹12,00,000: Tax = max(0, Tax - ₹60,000) [Rebate 87A]
5. Total Tax = Tax + (Tax × 4% Cess)
```

**Tax Calculation Formula (Old Regime):**

3. Tax = Apply age-based slab rates on Taxable Income
4. If Taxable Income ≤ ₹5,00,000: Tax = max(0, Tax - ₹12,500) [Rebate 87A]
